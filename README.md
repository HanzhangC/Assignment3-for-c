In this code, I worked on building a C program that processes paragraphs of text and generates formatted snippets. The program reads the text, identifies paragraph boundaries, and processes words, matching certain terms based on command-line input. The final task involves selecting and scoring the best snippets from each paragraph based on predefined rules, highlighting matched terms, and formatting the output to meet specific requirements.
